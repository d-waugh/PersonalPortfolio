<h1>The Best Movies According to Dayne</h1>
<h2> My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr> 

<h3>Oldboy</h3>
<p>This is one that I watched in more recent years, but it takes the concept of revenge and does an amazing job of showcasing why sometimes it is better to just let things go. After being imprisoned in a strange room for 15 years, Oh Dae-su wakes up inside of a suitcase on a rooftop in the middle of the city. His pursuit of revenge on the one who placed him there leads to intense situations that get exceedingly worse. The action, comedy, pacing, suspense, and acting are all among the best I've seen in any movie up to this point. South Korean cinema truly is one of a kind</p>

<h3>Kill Bill: Vol. 1</h3>
<p>A masterpiece in my eyes from the genius Quentin Tarantino. A former female assassin is shot by her employer while her fellow assassins watch on her wedding day. She miraculously survives the ordeal and swears to take out all of the members of the clan, including her employer Bill. Some of the best action sequences I have seen in a film and it never gets old, no matter how many times I rewatch it. This film follows a samurai/kung-fu theme, while volume 2 follows a more western approach. The drastic switch between the two is very unique and I think it is a perfect showcase of what Tarantino is capable of.</p>

<h3>Kung-Fu Hustle</h3>
<p>Comedy is something that can be easily lost in translation, especially from different cultures. Stephen Chow managed to create something that transcends those barriers and is hilarious to anyone who watches it. A Kung-Fu film set in the 1940's that follows a small complex rebelling against a notorious gang that terrorizes the area. There is a lot of slapstick humor in this movie and it lands every single time, even on a rewatch. The delivery on every one of these jokes, whether spoken or acted out, is nearly perfect. I have easily seen this film over 5 times and I probably will continue to do so for a very long time.</p>
